SaaSquatch Lead Quality Enhancer: Email Verifier
Improve your lead outreach efficiency by pre-validating email addresses from
SaaSquatch Leads exports.
🚀 Overview
This Python-based command-line tool is designed to enhance the quality of leads
generated by platforms like SaaSquatch Leads. While lead generation tools excel at
quantity, the actual deliverability of emails is crucial for effective sales outreach. This
Email Verifier script helps you identify and categorize email addresses as valid, invalid,
or risky before you initiate contact, saving time, protecting your sender reputation,
and improving your sales efficiency.
Problem Solved:
Sending emails to invalid addresses leads to:
● High Bounce Rates: Damages sender reputation, causing legitimate emails to
land in spam.
● Wasted Resources: Sales teams spend valuable time and effort on contacts that
will never receive their message.
● Inaccurate Metrics: Skews campaign performance data, making it hard to
assess true ROI.
● Frustration: For sales professionals striving to meet targets with unreliable data.
Value Proposition:
This tool directly addresses these pain points by providing a pre-outreach quality
check. By using this tool, companies can:
● Improve Deliverability: Significantly reduce email bounce rates.
● Increase Sales Efficiency: Focus efforts on genuinely reachable leads.
● Enhance Data Accuracy: Cleaner lead database for better prioritization.
● Optimize Campaign ROI: Ensure outreach costs are invested wisely.
✨ Features
● Syntax Validation: Checks if an email address adheres to a standard format
(e.g., name@domain.tld).
● Domain Existence Check: Verifies if the domain part of the email actually exists
(DNS A/AAAA record lookup).
● MX Record Lookup: Confirms if the domain is configured to receive emails (Mail
Exchange records).
● CSV Input/Output: Easily processes lead lists exported from SaaSquatch Leads
(or any other source) and outputs a new CSV with validation results.
● Clear Status Reporting: Adds a new column to your CSV indicating the validation
status for each email.
🛠 Installation
1. Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/saasquatch-lead-enhancer.git
cd saasquatch-lead-enhancer
(Replace https://github.com/your-username/saasquatch-lead-enhancer.git with
your actual repository URL)
2. Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required libraries using
pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 Usage
To run the email verifier, use the email_verifier.py script from your terminal:
python email_verifier.py --input_file sample_leads.csv --email_column "Email
Address"
● Replace sample_leads.csv with the path to your input CSV
file.
● Replace "Email Address" with the exact name of the column in your CSV that
contains the email addresses.
Example with sample_leads.csv:
python email_verifier.py --input_file sample_leads.csv --email_column "Email
Address"
By default, the script will create a new CSV file with _validated appended to the
original filename (e.g., sample_leads_validated.csv).
Optional: Specify Output File
You can also specify a custom output filename using the --output_file argument:
python email_verifier.py --input_file your_leads.csv --email_column "Email Address"
--output_file my_clean_leads.csv
📊 Output Explained
The script will generate a new CSV file (e.g., sample_leads_validated.csv) which
includes all original columns from your input file, plus a new column named
Email_Validation_Status.
Possible values in the Email_Validation_Status column:
● Valid: The email address passed all syntax, domain, and MX record checks.
● Invalid Syntax: The email address does not conform to a standard email format.
● Domain Not Found: The domain part of the email address (e.g., example.com in
user@example.com) does not exist.
● Domain No A/AAAA Record: The domain exists but has no A or AAAA DNS
records, indicating it might not be a valid host for email.
● No MX Records: The domain exists but is not configured to receive emails (no Mail
Exchange records found).
● No Nameservers: No nameservers could be found for the domain.
● DNS Timeout: The DNS query for the domain timed out.
● Empty Email: The email field was empty.
● Invalid Type: The value in the email column was not a string.
● Error: [message]: An unexpected error occurred during validation.
⚠️ Limitations & Future Enhancements (5-Hour Constraint)
This tool was developed within a 5-hour time limit, focusing on core, impactful
validation. Therefore, it has certain limitations and areas for future improvement:
● No Deep SMTP Verification: Does not perform a full SMTP handshake to confirm
mailbox existence, which often requires dedicated email verification APIs (e.g.,
ZeroBounce, Kickbox) due to rate limiting and anti-spam measures by mail
servers.
● No Disposable Email Detection: Does not identify temporary or disposable
email addresses.
● No Catch-All Detection: Does not detect domains configured to accept all
emails (catch-all servers), which can still result in bounces if the specific address
doesn't exist.
● No Greylisting/Spam Trap Detection: More advanced checks are outside the
scope of basic DNS/MX lookups.
● Command-Line Interface Only: No graphical user interface.
Potential Future Enhancements:
● Integration with a third-party email verification API for more robust checks
(disposable, catch-all, SMTP ping).
● Adding a simple web-based UI for easier file upload and download.
● Batch processing optimization for very large files.
● Integration with common CRM systems (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot) for direct lead
updates.
